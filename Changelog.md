# 0.1.2.3

- Lower minimum supported GHC to 8.6 and base to 4.12
- Improve generated documentation

# 0.1.2.1

- Disable cmm on 32 bit x86 architecture

# 0.1.2

- Add compare and swap operation
- Add flag to force non-CMM implementation (`no-cmm`), not that users should use it normally

# 0.1.1

- On non-javascript platforms the counter is implemented directly in
